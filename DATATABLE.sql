The project will diversify Peru's agro-industry, creating new jobs and sources of income, while also increasing the supply of a product with broad health benefits. A natural, high-purity, non-caloric product, Reb-A has a negligible effect on blood glucose; hence, it is attractive as a natural sweetener for diabetics and greatly beneficial to people on carbohydrate-controlled diets. Reb-A is derived from the leaf of the Stevia Rebaudiana (Stevia) plant. The Company plans to invest to: (i) acquire land and develop 1,000 hectares (ha.) of Stevia plantations; (ii) implement drip irrigation systems and mechanized harvesting; (iii) develop a Stevia tissue culture laboratory for propagation of Stevia plantlets; and, (iv) build a Reb-A extraction and refining facility capable of processing up to 12,000 metric tons of Stevia leaf.	\N	\N	\N	Interamerican Development Bank	\N	\N	1	In Procurement	0101000020E61000009568249DDC3453C0720BA7165BFA1CC0

The projects to be supported include four wind farms: Chiripa, Costa Rica (49.5MW) and Oaxaca II, Oaxaca III and Oaxaca IV, Mexico (102MW each). Acciona Energia is also considering two additional renewable energy concessions and intends to finance one of them through the proposed loan: a photovoltaic solar plant in Chile (30MW); or a wind plant in Punta Palmeras, Chile (39MW). The three Oaxaca projects recently completed construction and are in their long term take out financing phase, while the Chiripa wind farm is under due diligence for securing IDB financing (CR-L1060). Acciona Energia has 20 year experience in the renewable sector. Acciona, its parent company, has over 30,000 employees focused on sustainable renewable energy, infrastructure, water and environment projects.	\N	\N	\N	Interamerican Development Bank	\N	\N	1	In Procurement	0101000020E6100000CA31FE228D6655C0826CFE04BC892940

Under this project the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum (MoMP) is developing regulatory capacity to enforce sector laws and improve sector governance. At this time, the MoMP is seeking to identify firms and agencies with appropriate geological survey mapping/mineral exploration background and demonstrated experience in institutional strengthening in the mining sector.     Objectives:  The consultancy service will address the economically and socially promising subsector of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) in general and gemstone mining in particular. ASM mining can have strong regional labor market effects, rise income levels, create demand for different input goods, and can further trigger the development of the value chain if the processing of the products, for instance of gemstones, is conducted locally.	\N	Stephen Wheeler	wheelerss@state.gov	Post Identified Project	\N	\N	0	Pipeline	\N

Albania currently produces approximately 1.2 million tons of crude oil per year but, due to a lack of refining capacity, imports 600,000 tons of refined oil. 	\N	Donald Brown	brownda8@state.gov	Post Identified Project	\N	\N	0	Pipeline	0101000020E610000059912CBBBBFB334013AFFC4344844440
